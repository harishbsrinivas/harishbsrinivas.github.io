<title>Using a CanoScan LIDE 25 with sane and Ubuntu &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="In fiesty fawn  support for CanoScan LIDE 25 is broken. The scanner gets identified properly and goes thru the motions of scanning and has an progress indicator on the xsane window but the scanned image results in a blank window. This is a documented bug and might be fixed with the next release.
a work around to this is to use the command line version of sane, here is how to do it
1. plug the scanner into the USB port and run the following command  "sane-find-scanner "
you should see the follwing lines as pat of the output
found USB scanner (vendor=0x04a9 [Canon], product=0x2220 [CanoScan], chip=LM9832/3) at libusb:001:002
# Your USB scanner was (probably) detected. It may or may not be supported by
# SANE. Try scanimage -L and read the backend's manpage.
2. type in  "scanimage -L" at the terminal. you should see the follwing lines as part of the output

device `plustek:libusb:001:002' is a Canon LiDE25 USB flatbed scanner
3. you can now use the following command to get a scan
"scanimage --format=tiff --mode=Gray --depth=16 --resolution=100dpi  -l 0 -t 0 -x 215 -y 215 &gt;&gt; test"
you can set different options for the mode, depth and resolution to get better quality scans. to see the various options available try the"scanimage --help" command.
Update : I found a better method of fixing the scanner issue on this site
While the solution provided fixes any scanner broken during an update from previous versions to feisty the solution also works for fresh install of feisty as well.
here is how you fix the scanner in a nutshell
1. install scanbuttond using apt
2. list usb devices                             : lsusb
3. run scanbuttond                          : scanbuttond -r 1000000
3. list available imaging devices        : scanimage -L
4. Test basic scanner operation         : scanimage -T -d (Append output of scanimage -L here)
for e.g for my scanner the command looks like this "scanimage -T -d plustek:libusb:001:002"
5. Test gui scanner operation            : xsane
The above link gives you  more detailed instructions, you should refer to that site if you didn't understand the 5 steps above.
