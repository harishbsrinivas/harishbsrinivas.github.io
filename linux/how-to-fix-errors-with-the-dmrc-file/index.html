<title>How-to fix errors with the .dmrc file &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="After using Ubuntu over the last 30 days without any errors or problems I encountered an error "User’s $HOME/.dmrc” file is being ignored. This prevents the default session and language from being saved. File should be owned by user and have 644 permission. User $HOME directory must be owned by user and not writable by other users" after logging in today.
I tried googling for a fix, most sites asked me to change the file permissions to 644 as stated in the error message. I tried this fix and it did not work. After some more searching I came across this French site which had the solution.
To fix this error try the following
1. open a console window and at the prompt type the following to change the file permissions  and hit enter
chmod 644 ~/.dmrc
2. type the following command to change the ownership of the file and hit enter
 sudo chown your_login_name /home/your_login_name/.dmrc
3.  The final step is to assign permissions on the home directory such that it is accessible only to you ( this step is very important)
sudo chmod 700 /home/your_login_name
This should fix the problem and you should never see the error message again.
