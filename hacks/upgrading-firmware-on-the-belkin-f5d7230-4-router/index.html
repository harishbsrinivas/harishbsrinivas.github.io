<title>Upgrading Firmware on the Belkin F5D7230-4 router &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="After successfully flashing DD-WRT onto my FON router I wanted to try and upgrade my Belkin router to DD-WRT . The Belkin F5D7230-4 v2000 router is a cheap router based around the Broadcom chipset with 2mb of flash. The complete specifications for this router can be found here. After some research on the net I found out that

DD-WRT is partially supported on this router.
Since the available memory is too small nothing usable can be accomplished by upgrading the firmware.
Work is going on on several fronts to get DD-WRT micro edition compatible with this router.
A lot documentation is available to install a USB port as well as a serial console on this hardware.

The FCC ID for this particular router is FCC ID: K7SF5D7234A I decided to go ahead despite the fact that the router is partially supported by DD-WRT, You can easily recover from a bad flash by making sure the firmware is available to the router during startup. As stated on most sites I was able to flash the router successfully and got WLAN working but LAN ports were not working properly. Some of the sites that I found useful were

haxxed.com : Custom firmware for Belkin routers with 2MB Flash
F5D7230-4 v2000 firmware : Original firmware for the Belkin F5d7230-4 v2000 router.
TFTP server : TFTP server used to upload the firmware onto the router.

Note: DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT TRY FLASHING DD-WRT onto this particular router, you will gain no serious advantage and will be left with a router with no web based administration interface and will have to re-flash to original firmware.
