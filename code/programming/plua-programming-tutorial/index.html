pmoveto(10,55)
move to position 10(x),55(y)

addButton=pbutton("add")
store the ID of the button with label add in a variable called addButton

e,id = pevent()
function pevent() waits for an event and returns the ID and the type of event it encountered which are then stored in variables' e' and 'id'
if e == ctlSelect and id == addButton then
compare to see if the event is the add button is clicked if it is then add the contents of text filed 1 and 2 and display the result in text filed 3

compare to see if the event is the exit button is clicked if it is then pop up a confirmation box to determine of user really wants to quit
