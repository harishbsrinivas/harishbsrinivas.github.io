<title>A Google set-top box for every home? &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="Rumors are rife over the inter web that Google is prepping a super phone (code named Switch)  to directly compete with the iPhone while this might seem to be the next logical step for the search behemoth, what other avenues are they leaving unexplored.
The much mangled TV/set top box idea has been tried by Microsoft and a few other players but none of them are in the unique position that Google is in now. A TV/set top box can provide Google with the perfect avenue to consolidate all their existing services in one place and deliver it to a lot more people than before. For the generation who are growing up with Wii, Xbox and Play station it will be a natural transition.
With a set top box Google can reach millions of homes around the world where PC penetration is very less. This concept must not be confused with GoogleTV :P
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SK_M_nVWA]
think of the benefits:
1. Email : Gmail for every one (even for your grandma on her old analog TV).
2. Remotely hosted applications like the Google productivity suite (word processing, spreadsheet, presentations etc)
3. On demand streaming video with their YouTube or Google video service , you will naturally pay for the video rental using Google checkout :) .
4. A online news and feed reader (Google news &amp; Google reader).
5. on the fly Translation service.
6. classifieds and shopping with a combination of Google base, Froogle &amp; Google checkout
7. they can even have their own gaming franchise (Google games how does that sound, music to my ears :) )
8. voice and video calling with Gtalk.
9. Free WiFi with the TV box (Google acquired a lot of dark fiber over the last year and may soon turn into an ISP)
10. Online book rentals with Google books (Google could soon be your librarian).
11. Google maps and Google earth to plan your trips.
12. Close integration of all these services to you mobile or hand held device via Wifi/bluetooth sort of a Google on the go service.
13. Customized home page sort of like Google IG for each user (might be a bad idea from a usability stand point)
14. use your imagination, I cant think of any more....... :(
With the popularity of Tivo and other devices like game consoles such an idea would actually work this time around because of the vast financial ,technological the sheer amount of brains/sq meter at Googleplex. Google alrready provides customized hardware to corporates and a TV Set top box would be something similar but targeting the home user segment.
Theoretically such a device would obviously run on Linux and would have Firefox closely integrated with the OS ( insert obligatory Microsoft and IE integration joke here), The desktop would be minimalistic one modeled on the Wii interface with each service appearing as a channel and would in theory enable you to work on multiple application simultaneously.
The specifications for the device will be open (at least documentation for some user customizable i/o ports will be given, such that you can interface your own sensors etc, something like the ports available on the new Roomba devices ) such that hardware hackers can extend and add more functionality to the device. Google has tried this before with their software offerings such as Google desktop widgets, the Google maps API and more recently with Sketchup for Google earth and the community contribution to these projects are mind boggling.
The folks at Google have developed their own OS, their own hardware and their own delivery system, much of which can be utilized for this idea. A major hurdle to such a device would be handling user input, a conventional keyboard and mouse would not work and thus a new kind of interface must be developed. Wiimote has significantly contributed to this change but it still needs to improve a lot.
Minority report has a cool interface that some one is already implementing so maybe Google could hire that guy to develop the interface.

Another major issue would be security and maybe IP addresses (most of us still use ipv4) and ipv6 is still to see major deployment .
While all this seems great I shudder to think of what such an all encompassing (big brother) entity would be capable of :P
