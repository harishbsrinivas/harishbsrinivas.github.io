<title>Crap cleaner &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="Crap Cleaner is a nifty little tool that enables you to clean out all the junk and temporary files that mysteriously accumulates overtime on your windows PC. Every time you visit a site or  cookies temporary files and installer related files get stored in the temp folder, while there are a variety of tool that boast many optimization techniques the best so far is CCleaner from http://www.piriform.com/. The software is an effort to provide a utility that does just what it says clean crap from your computer at an unbeatable price "FREE". On a freshly installed computer running windows XP this tool is able to remove as much as 500MB of junk thus making way for your eclectic mix of Mp3's from various obscure bands and maybe more space for your files.

CCleaner can also fix certain issues with the registry, It can also be setup to run automatically at startup and for the paranoid "tinfoil hat" types can be setup to erase files by shredding them. It also includes an add/remove programs interface using which you can uninstall programs and a startup editor which can be used to prevent programs from starting up automatically when windows starts. Overall this utility is best suited if you don't want to spend 20-30$ on a swiss "army knife" of a utility that claims to do everything but does not do anything well.Go ahead and give it a try the small download size and the excellent performance will win you over. Nearly 350 million people have downloaded this utility you should too.
