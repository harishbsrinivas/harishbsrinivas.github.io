<title>Firefox - Secure browsing experience &#8211; TECH NOTES, RAMBLINGS & WHATNOTS</title>
<meta name="description" content="If you have been bothered with the increasing number of spyware and popup’s and various other annoyances while online then the answer to all your prayers and questions is not 42, it is Firefox :) .
Firefox is an open source free to download and use web browser that is highly customizeable and secure for browsing the Internet. It is one of the most standards compliant browser I have ever seen.
The best thing I like about Firefox is its Tabbed browsing interface I don’t need to open and close multiple browser windows and clutter up my task bar any more. I can open any number of windows inside Firefox and when I minimize it just becomes one window on the task bar.
The other feature I like about it is the search integration with Google. You can just type what you want to search In the address bar and it automatically searches Google.com and brings up the best match (similar to the I am feeling lucky button on Google) and redirects you to it&gt; If no exact match is found it will take you to the Google results page.
you can search the contents of a page by pressing the “/” key on the keyboard and it begins searching and highlighting the word,The search as you type feature is good, as you begin typing on the page it begins highlighting the words matching what you have typed.
other notable features include RSS &amp; auto update support.
There are over 110 extensions that can be installed on Firefox to enhance productivity.
some of the best extensions I use are
• ADblock- lets me block annoying ads, animations and flash content
• Mcsearchpreview-preview thumbnails of search results in google
• Quicknote-lets you take quick notes,and copy paste text or url’s into a small
notepad
• Spoofstick-prevents user from clicking on spoofed url and fake sites
you dont need to be worried about spywares,Trojans viruses or popups any more and can browse the Internet in a more safer and efficient manner now then when using Internet Explorer.
If you haven't downloaded and tried Firefox yet do it now as 13 million people have done so already in the past one month.
